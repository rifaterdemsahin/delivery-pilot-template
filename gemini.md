## 🗺 Project Self-Learning System — 7-Stage Journey

### Stage Overview: Unknown → Proven

| Stage | Folder | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `1_Real_Unknown` | **The "Why"** — Problem definitions, OKRs, core questions |
| 2 | `2_Environment` | **The "Context"** — Roadmaps, constraints, setup guides |
| 3 | `3_Simulation` | **The "Vision"** — UI mockups, image carousel |
| 4 | `4_Formula` | **The "Thinking & Planning"** — LLM reasoning logs, decisions, research, recipes |
| 5 | `5_Symbols` | **The "Reality"** — Core source code, implementation |
| 6 | `6_Semblance` | **The "Scars"** — Error logs, workarounds, gap analysis |
| 7 | `7_Testing_Known` | **The "Proof"** — Validation, checklists, outcome confirmation |

## 🛠 Core Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- **Static Hosting:** GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
- **Secrets Management:** Azure Key Vault (never commit secrets to git)
- **AI Stack:** Qdrant + Ollama (`nomic-embed-text`, 4096 dimensions)
- **Backend:** Fly.io for Python services
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

### Navigation & UI Rules

**Two menus required:**

1. **Project Menu** (always visible) — Links and functionality for the project being delivered. This is what end-users see.
2. **Debug Menu** (hidden by default) — All delivery-pilot-template framework links (7 stages, agent files, tools). Only shown when the user clicks the **debug button** at the **bottom-right corner** of the page.

**Menu behavior:**
- Debug button is always visible at bottom-right (small icon, e.g., bug/gear)
- Clicking debug button toggles the Debug Menu on/off
- Debug mode persists via `debug=true` cookie
- Both menus use Flexbox/Grid, responsive, and read from JSON config
- Search with autocomplete in the Debug Menu
- No direct link to `markdown_renderer.html`

### Social Links (required in `index.html`)
- GitHub Repository link
- LinkedIn: [rifaterdemsahin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rifaterdemsahin/) 🔗
- YouTube: [@RifatErdemSahin](https://www.youtube.com/@RifatErdemSahin) 📺

## 🤖 Gemini-Specific Instructions

### Behavior Guidelines
- Always follow the 7-stage structure when creating or organizing content
- **7-Stage Execution Flow** — Every task follows this cycle from start to resolution:
  1. **1_Real_Unknown — Scan & Map**: When receiving a new task, scan the project and map to this stage. Ensure there is a clear objective and that it relates to Key Results (OKRs). Update `problem_statement.md`, `okrs.md`, `hypotheses.md`, and `questions.md` as needed. → **Real Agent**
  2. **2_Environment — Update Blueprints**: Check if the environment needs updating. Update architectural blueprints (Mermaid diagrams in `architecture.md` or Excalidraw diagrams) — always keep them versioned. Update setup guides and tool documentation here when infrastructure or tooling changes. → **Environment Agent**
  3. **3_Simulation — Design New Versions**: Update visual designs and always create new version images. Log image generation prompts in `image_prompts.md`, update `carousel_config.json`. Design artifacts must be current before code enters `5_Symbols`. → **Simulation Agent**
  4. **4_Formula — Specs & Approval**: Follow or update the specs in `specs.md`. Document reasoning in `llm_thinking_log.md`. Get approval (specs + designs reviewed) before implementing in `5_Symbols`. This is the mandatory gating stage. → **Formula Agent**
  5. **5_Symbols — Implement**: Place all new source code here (except root files like `index.html`). Only enter this stage after the `4_Formula` gate approves the plan. Follow coding rules defined in `5_Symbols/rules/`. → **Symbols Agent**
  6. **7_Testing_Known — Test & Report**: After implementation, test the functionality and report the outputs. **Run smoke tests** that open pages, check for errors, and report failures to GitHub Issues. **Conduct code reviews** on the implementation. Use validation checklists and test evidence. If issues are found, create a GitHub Issue and loop back to `6_Semblance`. → **Test Agent**
  7. **6_Semblance — Fix & Resolve**: Document all errors, fixes, workarounds, and gap analyses. After testing reveals issues, fix them here and **mention the resolution**. Append to `error.log` and `fix.log`, update statuses, capture lessons learned. Resolve the corresponding GitHub Issues and publish a smoke test report to `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md`. → **Semblance Agent**
- **Mention Changes & Get Approvals** — When changes happen in `1_Real_Unknown` or `2_Environment`, mention/discuss the changes and get approvals. These approved changes cascade into updates in `3_Simulation` and `4_Formula` before any code is written.
- When adding files, place them in the appropriate numbered folder
- **After every command, commit and push** — do not batch changes; each step gets its own commit. If any git errors occur, proactively troubleshoot and resolve them.
- Use emojis (✨, 🛠, 🧪, 🐛) for scannability
- Leverage Gemini's multimodal capabilities for image analysis in `3_Simulation`
- **Record every prompt** in `prompts.md` — log date, agent, and purpose for each prompt given
- **README.md must include the public GitHub Pages URL** — e.g., `https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/<repo-name>/` (see [proxmox example](https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/proxmox/))
- **Keep `index.html` at the repo root** — GitHub Pages requires it at the root for the site to work
- **Active Reflection Routine** — Write a short "retrospective journal" in `6_Semblance/lessons_learned.md` after every milestone.
- **Keep Debug Menu Config Synchronized** — When markdown files are added, modified, or deleted in any stage, remember to update the debug menu configuration (`navigation_config.json` and the fallback arrays in `index.html` and `markdown_renderer.html`) to reflect these changes immediately.
- **Architecture Documentation Sync** — When the system architecture changes, immediately update the architecture overview document at `2_Environment/architecture.md` (with updated Mermaid diagrams) to keep it working.
- **Thinking & Planning Gate** — Before writing any code (`5_Symbols`), always document the approach and reasoning in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`. After execution, append a summary of the LLM reasoning process. `4_Formula` is the mandatory planning stage that encapsulates thinking before action.
- **Specs System** — Technical specifications live in `4_Formula/specs.md`. Before implementing any feature, create or update its spec. When new tasks arrive, check `4_Formula/specs.md` for existing specs that may be affected. If a task changes behavior covered by an active spec, flag it with `[NEEDS UPDATE]` and **warn** before writing code. Specs are validated against code in `5_Symbols`.
- **Design-First Rule** — Before delivering implementation (`5_Symbols`), always create image-based designs in `3_Simulation/` (mockups, wireframes, flow diagrams) and document specs in `4_Formula/`. Design files and spec documents must be updated whenever the feature changes. Design before code — `3_Simulation` + `4_Formula` gate `5_Symbols`.
- **Error & Fix Logging** — When any error occurs, append an entry to `6_Semblance/error.log` (format: `[DATE] [STAGE] [SEVERITY] — Description`). When a fix is applied, append to `6_Semblance/fix.log` (format: `[DATE] [STAGE] [STATUS] — Fix description`) with status `APPLIED`. After validation in `7_Testing_Known`, update the status to `VERIFIED`. Capture learnings in `6_Semblance/lessons_learned.md`.
- **Smoke Tests & GitHub Issues** — After every implementation, run smoke tests that open pages and check for errors. Report every failure as a GitHub Issue. Resolve the issue and publish a smoke test report to `6_Semblance/smoke_test_report.md`. Smoke tests gate deployment — do not deploy if any smoke test fails.

### Code Standards
- Use modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid) for responsive design
- Implement PrismJS for syntax highlighting in `5_Symbols`
- Use Mermaid for architecture diagrams
- All markdown files must be accessible via `markdown_renderer.html`

### Lifecycle Management
- Move obsolete files to `_obsolete/` sub-folder within their directory 🚮
- Every folder must have a Testing Checklist with an embedded YouTube video

### Secrets & Environment
- Use Azure Key Vault for all secrets — enterprise-grade security at low cost with pay-per-operation pricing
- Create a matching Key Vault per environment (dev/staging/prod) in Azure Portal
- Never push secrets to GitHub
- Reference `.env.example` for required variables
