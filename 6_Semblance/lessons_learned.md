## 📅 2026-05-31: Stage 1 Kanban Implementation & Navigation Setup

### What went well
- Created a standard Markdown-based `kanban.md` that traces tasks back to the 7-Stage Framework.
- Updated the centralized navigation menus (`navigation_config.json`, fallback JSON objects in `index.html`, and `markdown_renderer.html`) to expose the Kanban board as a direct debug option.
- Verified how `markdown_renderer.html` resolves directory paths (defaults to `README.md`) and correctly formatted links.

### Gaps & Challenges
- Navigation fallbacks are duplicated in `index.html` and `markdown_renderer.html`. In the future, it might be cleaner to isolate the fallback menu logic to a shared JS utility, but keeping them synchronized manually works for now and maintains resilience.

### Takeaway for Future AI Agents
- When completing tasks, make sure to update the status of the tasks in `1_Real_Unknown/kanban.md` using matching commit messages.

## 📅 2026-05-31: Stage 1 Cost Tracker Setup

### What went well
- Established a unified structure to track both system infrastructure costs and API token consumption in `1_Real_Unknown/costs.md`.
- Kept navigation fallbacks in sync so that the project menu operates reliably.

### Gaps & Challenges
- Estimates for Key Vault and container execution can fluctuate. Agents should update the log on every significant run/operation to prevent budget surprises.
